# Contributing

The primary branch that will be built and deployed is the `master` branch. This branch should always build, lint and all tests should successfully execute.

Code can only be merged to the `master` branch using a PR, once the PR has been reviewed and any changes made it will be merged.

## New Tasks

When picking up a `new` task to work on you should create a branch with a `feature` prefix, always include the task number and an abbreviated version of it's title.

e.g. If the task is titled `1 Create a README file for the repo` the branch would be something like `feature/1_Create_README`

## Bug Fixes

When picking up a `fix` task to work on you should create a branch with a `fix` prefix, always include the task number and an abbreviated version of it's title.

e.g. If the bug fix is titled `4 Calling API returns undefined` the branch would be something like `fix/4_Calling_API`

## Tests

Where relevant you should create unit tests to support your code.

## Creating a PR

When your code is ready to merge, first commit any changes to your branch.

When it is ready to submit take the following steps:

* Create the PR
* You can then request a review

If it is necessary for you to make changes the reviewer will add comments and then assign the task back to you.
